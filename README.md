# README

This is a small website built in ruby on rails for an university project.
Since it was only a test it's not refined, since the main focus for the software was to learn how gems worked, and to get an understanding of how RoR works.

The things the website does is:
* has accounts, so every user can add their favorite series and mangas using info from the website myanimelist.net
* connects to myanimelist.net to get details about series, mangas and authors shown in real time in the website
* accepts commands in the searchbox such as "anime:jojo" to filter search results
* supports comments and a local rating section

The website was only a test, so it's frozen since the final presentation I made. Some gems and functionalities may have gotten unsupported.
